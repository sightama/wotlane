# Mods: how to make them

A mod is a folder inside `mods/` (next to the ELF, at the root of the extracted disc the game uses: `<runtime>\discroot\mods\`). It
mirrors the disc tree, and whatever is there takes the place of the disc file. Nothing of the game is changed and nothing goes into the repo.

```
discroot/mods/
  my_mod/
    MON/lizard0_t0004.png      Togera texture as PNG (any resolution)
    MON/lizard0_rtx_t0003.png  Togera portrait in the HUD
    VAG/CITYAMB.VPK            replaced music
    SND/LIZARD_S.BNK           replaced sound bank
  _work/                       the kit's work folders, one per mod (starts with '_': the game does not read it)
    my_mod/                    my_mod's PNGs and WAVs being edited, with its modkit.json
```

Loader rules (`native/wotm_mods.hpp`): a folder that starts with `_` or `.` is disabled; when two mods have the same file, the
last one in alphabetical order wins (you can use `10_base`, `20_extra`); `WOTM_MODS=<folder>` changes the folder and `WOTM_MODS=0` turns
everything off. The log (`logs\live.err.log`) names each file and each texture that came from a mod (`[mods] ...`).

**Project mods** live in `mods/<mod>/` at the repo root and are only original art and configuration (JSON, hand-drawn PNG): Goliath
Prime (`mods/Goliath Prime/`), Cerebulon (`mods/Cerebulon/`) and the "Recompiled" logo of the intro (`mods/recompiled_logo/`).
`tools/sync_mods.ps1` mirrors each folder of `mods/` to `<runtime>\discroot\mods\` (`run_live.ps1` calls it on every boot and
`setup_runtime.ps1` at install time; `WOTM_RECOMP_DIR` or `.wotm_recomp_dir` say where the runtime is). Only the folders that exist in
the repo are mirrored; the ones that exist only in `discroot\mods\` (yours, `_work`) are left as they are. Without a `mods` folder (with
that exact name: on Windows the path `mods` falls into the disc's `MOD\`, the IRX one) next to the ELF, the game and the launcher read
the repo's `mods/` (`WOTM_REPO`, which `run_live.bat` and the launcher pass). An edited disc texture (a PNG out of
`modkit.py`) is game art and does not go into the repo, except as new art on top (the case of the logo).

## Interface (`tools/modkit_gui.py`, the launcher's "Mod kit" button)

`pythonw tools/modkit_gui.py`, or the **Mod kit** button of `WotM_Launcher.exe`. Needs Python 3 with Pillow (`pip install pillow`). The window is in English.

A mod is a project: at the top, **Mod: [list] [New mod...]** picks the mod (New mod creates the mod's folder and its work folder,
`<mods>/_work/<mod>/`; the name takes only letters, digits, `_` and `-`, starting with a letter or digit). When you pick the mod, its
files that the work folder does not have (a mod made earlier or by hand) are copied into it and show up as edited; Build takes them back.
A file removed from the work folder on purpose does not come back. The picked mod governs Extract, the right-hand list and Build; changing the mod changes the whole
workspace. With no mod, the right-hand list is empty and the buttons tied to it are disabled, with the hint "Pick or create a mod first".

1. **Pick from the disc** (left): monsters by name and costume (Togera › Costume 1, and its sound banks), bosses, stages by the
   game's name, menu and screens, sound banks, music and voice lines. Search field; Ctrl/Shift pick several; double click or "Extract selected".
2. **Edit <mod>'s work folder** (right): one group per disc file ("MON/MONKEY0 (Congar, costume 1)"); after extracting, the
   new group opens and the others close. Thumbnails, size and state ("edited" = changed since extraction). A texture the export could
   not color comes out gray with `_sempaleta` (no palette) in the name; `pack` writes it without the suffix (the game accepts both). Preview
   of the image (with a checkerboard behind the alpha) or the sound's waveform. A sound plays in the window itself on click ("play sounds on click"
   turns that off) or on double click; "Stop" stops it. Double click on a texture opens it in the editor chosen in **Editors...** (one program per
   type, `.png` and `.wav`; empty = the Windows default program; with a `.wav` editor set, double click on a sound opens it there).
   Right click on the list: Play, Open in ..., **Open with...** (picks the program and asks whether it becomes the default), **Replace with...** (only with one file
   selected: replaces it with the file you pick and writes it under the right name; JPG, BMP, TGA etc. become PNG; warns if the aspect ratio
   changes; a sound only accepts WAV), Show in folder, **Revert to original** (only shows up if there are edited files in the selection; on a group,
   reverts its edited files; extracts from the disc again and asks for confirmation first),
   **Save to folder...** (copies the selected files, or the whole group, to a folder) and Remove (the Del key too). Clicking a
   section only selects it: open and play apply only to files picked one by one; on the section, right click saves or removes everything.
3. **Build** (bottom): **Build mod** (the `pack` of the picked mod), **Check mods**, **Open mods folder** and **Open work folder**. The log
   is at the bottom, with a divider you can drag up and down.

The folders (disc and mods), the last mod, the editors, the log height and the last "Save to folder" folder are kept in
`~/.wotm_modkit.json`. Underneath are the same functions as `modkit.py` below.

**Skins through the window.** **New skin...** (in the list header, next to Refresh) opens a dialog: *Monster* (a list with the ten
playable monsters and the known custom monsters; it also accepts a typed id, which counts as a custom monster id: no extracted textures
and a `skin.json` without `base`), *Base costume* (0 to 3, with the portrait of each costume; a costume that is not on the disc is disabled; for a
custom the default is the `costume` from `monster.json`), *Name*, *Id* (derived from the name, editable) and "CPUs may pick this skin". It creates the
`skin.json` in `mods/<mod>/skins/<id>/` and extracts the base costume's textures to the work folder. In the list, the skin is its own
group at the top ("Skin: NAME (monster/id, base N)"); when it is selected, the preview turns into the properties panel (Name, Base, CPUs may pick,
**Save** rewrites the `skin.json`). Right click on the group: **Duplicate skin...** (copies the skin in the mod and in the work folder under the new
id) and **Delete skin**. With a playable monster's costume group selected (e.g. "MON/SHOGUN3"), the header's **Turn into skin...** button (also
on right click) creates the skin with that monster and costume and moves the group's PNGs to its folder, so the original costume stays untouched on Build; if the mod already has
those PNGs packed in `MON/`, the window warns and offers to delete them.

## The kit on the command line (`tools/modkit.py`)

```
python tools/modkit.py export my_mod MON/LIZARD0          # Togera's .TEX and .RTX as PNG, in my_mod's work folder
python tools/modkit.py export my_mod SND/LIZARD_S.BNK VAG/CITYAMB.VPK
  (edit the files in mods/_work/my_mod/)
python tools/modkit.py pack my_mod [--inject]             # takes what changed to mods/my_mod/
python tools/modkit.py check [my_mod]                     # checks the mods' names, sizes and texIds and the conflicts between them
python tools/modkit.py revert my_mod MON/lizard0_t0004.png   # returns a work folder file to the disc original
```

- A mod is a project: the work folder is `<mods>/_work/<mod>/`, with its `modkit.json`, and the `pack` of one mod never takes what
  was edited for another. `--work <folder>` changes the work folder.
- Reads the repo's extracted disc (`disc/`, or `--disc`/`WOTM_DISC`) and writes to the runtime's mods (`.wotm_recomp_dir` + `discroot\mods`,
  or `--mods`). Wildcards work (`MON/LIZARD*`); without an extension it takes `.TEX` and `.RTX`.
- `pack` only takes what changed since the export (sha1 in `_work/<mod>/modkit.json`). Exporting again does not overwrite what was already edited.
- `check` ignores `_work`. Each file, PNG, skin or monster line is marked "(overrides X)" or "(overridden by Y)" when another
  enabled mod has the same key, and the output ends with the section "conflicts between enabled mods": one line per repeated key (PNG
  by stem/rtx/texId, file by path, skin by `monster/id`, custom monster by id) with the mods and which one wins (the last in
  alphabetical order). `check <mod>` shows only the conflicts that involve that mod. It also warns about a skin whose `monster` is neither
  playable nor a known custom.

| On the disc | In the work folder | `pack` writes |
|---|---|---|
| `.TEX` | `<file>_tNNNN.png` (one per texture) | the PNG as is |
| `.RTX` | `<file>_rtx_tNNNN.png` (portraits, screens, fonts) | the PNG as is |
| `.VPK` / `.VAG` | `<file>.wav` | `.VPK`/`.VAG` (same rate and volumes as the original) |
| `.BNK` | `<bank>_sNNN.wav` (one per sound with a sample) | the bank with all the edited sounds replaced (a sample that another sound also uses: the edited one gets its own copy and the other keeps the original) |
| others | copy | copy |

## Textures as PNG

- The game still loads the `.TEX`/`.RTX` from the disc; the native drawing swaps the image at draw time
  (`native/wotm_texmods.hpp`). That is why the PNG can have **any resolution** (HD textures): object UVs are normalized, and the
  screen quads (bar portraits, font) scale the region by the ratio between the PNG and the original texture. Keep the
  original's aspect ratio (`check` warns).
- It works in any folder of the mod (the file name is enough) and for every palette that uses the texture.
- Alpha: the PNG uses the same scale as the original texture, the way the export writes it. Most of the game's textures go from 0 to 0xFF
  (double the GS's opaque 0x80); in those the PNG's alpha is taken raw, 255 = 0xFF, and the log says "raw alpha, 255 = 0xFF". In the ones that
  stop at 0x80, 255 = 0x80 (the rest / 2). In practice: 255 is the opaque the game uses, and the export and `pack --inject` round-trip without losing anything.
  This matters for textures like the title logo (SHELL t140/t141), which the game draws with the vertex at half opacity, counting
  on the 0xFF. A semi-transparent PNG from an old version of the kit may come out more opaque: export again. Textures without alpha in the game
  (TEX0.TCC = 0) ignore the PNG's alpha.
- An image split across several textures (the title logo is two 256 × 256 side by side, upside down): scale the whole image
  once and cut exactly in the middle, with no overlap; cuts made by hand with a margin repeat a piece at the seam.
- Particles (fire, sparks, explosions, debris, pedestrians, lens flare): their textures live in the stage's `.TEX` (in Midtown
  Park, `central_t0004` to `t0059` and `t0289`), so the PNG goes under the stage's name and applies only there; to replace one in all of them,
  one PNG per stage. Particle UVs are also normalized: any resolution works. Photo of the fire in green at double resolution:
  `docs/screenshots/2026-10-25/2026-10-25_mods_png_particulas.png`.
  - In Midtown Park: explosion = `t0008` to `t0039` (32 frames of 64 × 64); electric arc (Kineticlops' beam, Robo-47's dome)
    = `t0057` (128 × 64); pedestrians = `t0289` (128 × 128 sheet, figures of ~8 × 16, upside down).
  - The size on screen comes from the game's effect, not from the PNG: a bigger PNG only has more pixels in the same quad. Upscaling (Real-ESRGAN
    and the like) only shows when the particle is larger on screen than the original texture. On the beam and the explosion seen in a fight
    it is not noticeable (`docs/screenshots/2026-10-25/2026-10-25_mods_png_raio_sem_e_com_upscale.png`); on pedestrians up close it is,
    but the models invent shape where the original has few pixels
    (`docs/screenshots/2026-10-25/2026-10-25_mods_png_pedestres_upscale.png`,
    `docs/screenshots/2026-10-25/2026-10-25_pedestres_folha_original_e_animesharp.png`). For smaller or sharper particles,
    redraw: a smaller drawing in the center, with more transparent border, shows up smaller.
- It does not apply to the composited dust/smoke (the game builds it in VRAM every frame) nor to the emulated GS's image
  in `ps2EntryRunner` (the reference of the VU1 check; its window uses the PNG). For that one, `pack --inject` also rewrites the mod's `.TEX`/`.RTX` when the PNG has the
  original size (the colors go into the current palette).
- How the native layer finds the file: the upload packet of `texInfo[texId]` is inside the `.TEX` (or `.RTX`) loaded at
  `fileStatus.texAddr[i]` (`resAddr[i]`); the offset inside it gives the disc texId, and the name is `fileStatus.names[i]`. The
  resident ones (T8H/T4HL/T4HH) come through the DBP, as in `decodeResident`.

## Skins (extra costumes, without replacing any)

A skin is a folder in `mods/<mod>/skins/<folder>/` with a `skin.json`:

```json
{ "monster": "ultra-v", "id": "roxo", "name": "PURPLE ULTRA V", "base": 3, "ai": true }
```

- `monster`: the playable monster's name (`congar`, `robo-47`, `togera`, `ultra-v`, `preytor`, `kineticlops`, `magmo`, `raptros`,
  `agamo`, `zorgulon`), the file prefix (`SHOGUN`) or the `id` of a custom monster (`moddedtogera`; see "Custom monsters"). A
  custom's skin only shows up in that custom's list, never in the base monster's column nor in the AI draw; without `base`, the `costume`
  from `monster.json` applies.
- `id`: lowercase letters, digits and `_` (without it, the folder name). The save stores `"ultra-v/roxo"`.
- `name`: what the select screen shows. `base`: the disc costume (0 to 3) that supplies whatever the folder does not bring, and the costume's sounds.
  `ai`: whether randomly drawn AIs can use it (default no).
- A mod skin is always unlocked: it does not go through the unlock screen.
- What goes in the folder, from simplest to most complete:
  - **PNGs only**: model and textures of the base costume; the PNGs replace the textures. Named like the base costume's export
    (`shogun3_t0010.png`, `shogun3_rtx_t0011.png`) or just `t0010.png`/`rtx_t0011.png`. They apply **only to the skin**: the real costume 3
    keeps its own texture, even in the same fight.
  - **`.TEX` and/or `.RTX`** (any name, going by the extension): its own textures, with the same texIds as the base (`modkit pack --inject`
    writes them this way).
  - **`.NGP` + `.PTR`** (always both): its own model, with the same skeleton and animations as costume 0.
- The game sees each skin as one more costume of the monster (`MON/SHOGUN4.*`, `SHOGUN5.*`...; numbers assigned on each boot, in
  mod/id order). Same monster and id in two mods: the last in alphabetical order wins. The log says what got in:
  `[mods] skin ultra-v/roxo ("PURPLE ULTRA V", my_mod) = costume 4 (SHOGUN4); base 3, 2 png`.
- In the menu (the native select screen of screens 3, 6, 7 (2-player minigames), 18 and 19 and of the 3- and 4-player one): up/down goes through the
  disc costumes and then through the monster's skins, always unlocked, and more than one player can pick the same one. Through `WOTM_MATCH` too
  (`WOTM_MATCH=4:roxo,...`) and through the launcher (each monster's skin box lists its mod skins). The 3D model on the select screen and in the save list shows the skin's PNGs.
- In the fight the skin uses the sounds of the `base` costume (Preytor base 1 and Agamo base 3 have their own sounds). Log:
  `[mods] skin ultra-v/roxo (costume 4) in the fight with the sounds of costume 3`.
- **Save:** the adventure stores the skin by name (`"costume": "ultra-v/roxo"`; the disc costumes stay as 0 to 3). Without the mod, the slot
  loads with costume 0 (log `[wotm] save: costume ... not found (missing mod?); using costume 0`, and "skin missing" in the save list);
  saving the same adventure keeps the name, and the skin comes back when the mod comes back.
- **Randomly drawn AIs** (endurance): with `"ai": true`, the skin enters the draw for that monster's AI costume, along with the costume the
  game would pick (log `[mods] AI N drew skin ...`). The adventure's AIs keep the game's costumes.
- **Kit:** `python tools/modkit.py skin new <mod> <monster> <id> [--base N] [--name "GREEN TOGERA"] [--ai]` creates the `skin.json` and exports the
  base costume's textures to `mods/_work/<mod>/skins/<id>/`; edit the PNGs and run `modkit.py pack <mod>`: only the edited ones go to the
  skin's folder. `<monster>` can also be a custom monster's id: if the kit finds its `monster.json` (in the repo's `mods/` or in the
  mods folder), it exports the base type's textures in the custom's `costume` (or in `--base`), and the `skin.json` comes out without `base` when
  `--base` is not given. An unknown id creates only the `skin.json`, with a warning.
  In the window, the same through **New skin...**, the skin's properties panel and **Turn into skin...** (section "Interface").
- **In game:** CREATE on the 1 player modes screen makes a recolor skin of any disc costume and writes it to
  `mods/Creator/skins/<id>/` (NATIVO.md, "Runtime: character creator"); it is the same folder format, so the kit opens it and
  the folder can be shared by copying it. The kit's PNG name pattern (`PNG_RE` in `tools/modkit.py`) expects a costume prefix
  before `_t`, so it handles the creator's bare `t0004.png`/`rtx_t0011.png` only partly: they come into the work folder without
  their size, they pack unchanged, and **Revert to original** cannot find their disc source.
- Not yet: elimination. In it the game loads costume 0 of every monster only once and the
  players switch monsters between rounds without reloading: picking a costume there requires changing the load, not just the screen.

Example (`WOTM_MATCH=4:roxo,4:3,1`, AI): the skin with the recolored PNG comes out green and costume 3 next to it stays purple;
a skin with only a `skin.json` (`togera/demonio`, base 3) loads costume 3's model. Photo:
`docs/screenshots/2026-10-23/2026-10-23_skin_mod_png_so_na_skin.png`.

## Custom monsters (one more monster on the select screen)

Custom monsters are experimental: the owner's mods for their own game, with no guarantee that everything works (Goliath has no
climbing animations nor AI outside its own stage). A custom monster is a folder in `mods/<mod>/monsters/<folder>/` with a `monster.json`. Today it uses the code, the model and the files
of a game type (`base`); its own files (another prefix in `MON/`, a free game type) are left for later, and the format reserves
`files` for that. The first one is Goliath Prime (`mods/Goliath Prime/monsters/goliath/monster.json`, in the repo):

```json
{ "id": "goliath", "name": "GOLIATH PRIME", "base": "assboss", "costume": 1,
  "camera": { "from": "togera", "scale": 200 }, "narrator": "goliathprime",
  "portrait": "goliathprime.png" }
```

- `id`: lowercase letters, digits and `_` (without it, the folder name). It is what `WOTM_MATCH` accepts (`WOTM_MATCH=goliath,3,1`).
- `name`: what the select screen and the HUD show. The HUD has 11 letters: it uses the last word that fits, in lowercase ("goliath").
- `base`: the game type, by name or prefix: the ten playable ones (`togera`, `LIZARD`...) or a boss that is a `Monster` (`kCustomBases`,
  `native/wotm_mods.hpp`): `assboss` (13, Goliath), `jelly` (14, Cerebulon's second phase) and `final` (15, Cerebulon, the last
  phase). A custom with a playable base runs that monster's code and AI; only Goliath has been tested (to change only the look, use
  a skin).
- `costume`: the disc costume (`ASSBOSS1`; `ASSBOSS0` is a prototype with half the animations and the small portrait; `JELLY0` and
  `FINAL0` only have costume 0).
- `camera`: another monster's camera (`from`, by the game's name) with the distances scaled (`scale` in %, 10 to 1000; the port's JSON
  only reads integers). The game never used `ASSBOSS.CHR` (in the adventure the camera is the stage's), and it leaves the camera on top of the
  monster, and the one from `JELLY.CHR` ends up between Jelly's legs; Togera's at 2x (Goliath) and 3x (Jelly) behaves like a regular
  monster's. The one from `FINAL.CHR` already works. The port reads the camera from the `from` monster's `.CHR` (from `mods/` or from the disc) and puts it on the monster on every
  POV change (log `[custom] jelly: camera from RST/LIZARD.CHR, distances x3.00 (POV 0: ...)`).
- `narrator`: `narrator/<name>.mp3`, spoken on confirmation (empty = the type's).
- `ai`: whether a CPU can use it (default no); without it the select screen shows "PLAYERS ONLY" in the CPU's frame. With `"ai": true` the CPU can
  pick it in the select screen's CUSTOM slot; the launcher only offers customs to the player. A custom with a playable base fights as a CPU
  (`WOTM_MATCH=1,moddedtogera,1`, with `"base": "togera"`: it walks, attacks, breathes fire and loses the round like a Togera), and so do Jelly and
  Cerebulon (`WOTM_MATCH=1,cerebulon,1`: the game's regular AI, the same one that moves Cerebulon in the final stage). Goliath does not: its AI
  (`Ai::updateAssBoss`) needs the points of its own stage, and as a CPU (`WOTM_MATCH=3,goliath,1`) it loads but does not show up in the fight.
- **On the select screen** (screens 3, 6, 7, 18 and 19 and the 3- and 4-player one, outside elimination): the CUSTOM slot of the monster bar. X opens the list of customs inside the
  player's frame (name, mod, how many skins; in a CPU frame, "PLAYERS ONLY" on those without `"ai"`): up and down scroll, X picks, triangle
  closes. Once one is picked, the frame shows the monster like the game's own: up and down change costume (the `costume` from `monster.json` and the
  custom's skins, in gold), X confirms, triangle goes back to the closed slot. With the list open, left and right do not leave the
  slot. On the game's screens, on confirmation the game's cursor stays on the column the frame came from, which stands in for it (that column's spot
  is not taken). On the 3- and 4-player one (`customStep` in `wotm_padsel.inc`) the choice is entirely ours: the custom's type goes to the frame's
  `m_monsterSel` and the costume to the frame's costume (players 3 and 4 through `wotmMultiSetCostume`, CPUs in `m_costume[2 + c]`).
- **Launcher:** the customs show up in "Your monster", after Random (only for the player).
- **What the port does for Goliath** (`native/runtime/wotm_custom.inc`): it is visible and controllable with AIs in the fight
  (`SetAIMonster` turned it off), takes damage from them (`takeHit` only accepted hits from player 1), loads the boss's sound bank outside
  the adventure and puts the name in the HUD. Also: X+Square does the boss's spin (`StateTopSpin`, in place of the regular monsters'
  `StateCrowdControl`; the full hit applies against the nearest AI), the turret no longer follows the enemy all the time (the boss's "look" turns the
  whole torso; with lock-on it aims) and the dart (impale) becomes a regular hit on anyone without the impaled animations (otherwise
  it froze). Investigations (closed): `git show 18bb1d2:docs/investigacoes/2026-10-23/goliath_topspin.md`, `goliath_lockon.md`, `goliath_impale.md`.
- **HUD portrait:** the one in `ASSBOSS1.RTX` (texId 6) is a placeholder, with Congar's face. `"portrait": "goliathprime.png"` (in the
  monster's folder or at the mod root; 128 × 64 or larger with the same aspect ratio, e.g. 512 × 256) replaces the portrait image of the custom's costume
  (`"portraitTex"`: the texId in the `.RTX`; default 6 for `ASSBOSS1`). It also applies to the adventure's boss, which uses the same file.
  Log: `[mods] ASSBOSS1.RTX t6 <- Goliath Prime/goliathprime.png`.
- Not yet: animations that ASSBOSS does not have (climbing, some blocks and counters; `18bb1d2:docs/investigacoes/2026-10-23/goliath_codigo.md`,
  section 3) make the game hold the previous pose; elimination and minigames have not been tested with it; the adventure save does not store
  customs (the adventure does not offer the slot).

### Cerebulon (the `mods/Cerebulon/` mod, in the repo)
The two phases of the final boss that are `Monster`s: `jelly` ("JELLY", base `jelly`, Togera's camera at 3x) and `cerebulon` ("CEREBULON",
base `final`), both with `"ai": true` and the `cerebulon` narrator. The first phase, the Mecha, is a piece of the final stage
(`FinalBoss::updateMecha`), not a `Monster`, and is not included.
- **What the port does for them** (`wotm_custom.inc`): visible and controllable with AIs (`SetAIMonster` turned off types 0x1C0 and
  0x1E0 and counted them as AI), also visible as CPUs outside the adventure, the `Final_s.bnk` sound bank outside the final stage and the name in the
  HUD ("JELLY WINS", "CEREBULON CRUSHED").
- **How the game treats them** (from the retail code, they apply to the player): Jelly has no rage (`Monster.cpp`, rage), does not grab nor get grabbed
  (`Grapple.cpp`) and Cerebulon does not pick up the special item (`PowerUps.cpp`). The hits, jump and throws come from the animations of
  `JELLY0`/`FINAL0`.
- **Jelly's shock** (`StateUltraTazer`, its special): **Triangle + Circle** (the regular monsters' special combination
  in control type A), with the special available. The game's `transitionOK`
  asks for no button (in the final stage the `FinalBoss::updateJelly` script decides), and with Jelly as a player the shock went off
  by itself; the port only lets it start with both buttons held on the player's pad. The shock spends the special, and a player Jelly
  picks up the special item like a regular monster (retail refuses it to types 0x1C0/0x1E0). CPU Jelly: as in retail.
  **Target:** `StateUltraTazer::update` aims at `game->m_monsters[0]` (in the final stage, the player), with no distance limit; with
  Jelly as a player, during the shock that target is the nearest living enemy (any active monster, player or CPU). The shock only
  starts with an enemy within 1200 (Jelly is huge: in a fight the enemy stays at ~700–1100) and ends if none stays within 1500.
  Log: `[custom] Jelly: shock target type 1 at 787`, `[custom] Jelly: shock (Triangle+Circle)`, or
  `[custom] Jelly: shock with no enemy within 1200 (nearest at 1250)`.
- The HUD portrait stays gray (no `"portrait"`).

Example: the select screen of screen 6 (1 player against CPU), CUSTOM → GOLIATH PRIME, the CPU refused in the slot,
a fight in Midtown Park with camera, sound and name. Photo: `docs/screenshots/2026-10-23/2026-10-23_selecao_casa_custom_goliath.png`.

## Stages (maps)

A map is a stock stage with some of its pieces moved, turned or removed. It is a folder in `mods/<mod>/stages/<id>/` and holds no
disc data: only the list of edits, applied to the disc's stage when it loads (`native/wotm_stagemap.hpp`,
`native/runtime/wotm_stagemap.inc`; design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-09-map-creator-design.md`, issue #10).

```
mods/my_mod/
  stages/
    downtown/            the map's id: the folder name (lowercase; a letter, then a-z, 0-9 and _, up to 16)
      stage.json         the edits
      photo.png          optional: the stage select picture (2:1); without it, the base stage's picture
```

`stage.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "DOWNTOWN MESS",
  "base": "CENTRAL",
  "baseHash": "c71c34ca37a35711",
  "edits": [
    { "node": "0x165a70", "move": [-185.7, 475.8, 0.0], "turn": 90 },
    { "node": "0x18a410", "remove": true }
  ]
}
```

- `name`: what the stage select shows, 1 to 17 of `A-Z`, `0-9`, space and `-`.
- `base`: the stock stage, by its file name in `LVL/` (`CENTRAL`, `TOKYO`, `UFO`...).
- `baseHash`: 16 hex digits, FNV-1a 64 of the inflated base `.NGP`. A disc (or a mod that replaces `LVL/<STAGE>.NGP`) whose stage
  does not match refuses the map instead of patching the wrong bytes: `[stages] <id>: base CENTRAL does not match this disc`.
- `edits` (at most 4096), one per piece (`node`: the piece's offset in the inflated image, a multiple of 4; the first edit of a
  node counts):
  - `move`: the piece's new world position `[x, y, z]` (absolute, world units; z is up). Its collision goes with it: the loader
    relinks the stage's collision grid to the new place, so the building is solid where it now stands and not where it stood.
  - `turn`: degrees about the vertical axis, added to the piece's own rotation, about its own position. With or without `move`
    (`stage_map.py make`: `--turn 0x..=degrees`, or a fourth number in `--move`).
  - `remove: true` (alone): the piece is gone, drawing and collision.
- Unknown keys in an edit are refused; the scan logs why a folder was skipped (`[stages] my_mod/stages/x ignored: ...`).

**What a piece is.** A building, prop, destructible or level pickup with its own position in the stage: the nearest `TRANSLATE` or
`ROTATE` above it, with no other transform above that. Ground and terrain, pedestrians and animated parts (vehicles, moving
props) are not pieces. `CENTRAL` (Midtown Park) has 317: 202 in the world (55 of them with collision, all destructible) and
115 level pickups. The full rule is in `tools/stage_map.py`'s docstring.

**Making one with `tools/stage_map.py`** (until the in-game editor; reads the extracted disc in `disc/`, or `--disc`):

```
python tools/stage_map.py pieces disc/LVL/CENTRAL.NGP          # one line per piece: node, kind, position, collision paths, destructible
  0x61e340  TRANSLATE  pos 688.2 119.6 0.0  paths 1  destructible
python tools/stage_map.py make --base CENTRAL --id downtown --name "DOWNTOWN MESS" --out mods/my_mod/stages --move "0x165a70=-185.7,475.8,0,90" --remove 0x18a410
                                                               # writes mods/my_mod/stages/downtown/stage.json with the baseHash
python tools/stage_map.py check disc/LVL/*.NGP                 # the collision grid rule on stock stages or on a WOTM_STAGE_DUMP
python tools/stage_map.py ram ram_2400.bin --monster 0:140:156 # monsters and pickups in a fight's RAM (PS2X_DUMP_RAM)
```

`--move` is `node=x,y,z[,turn]`, `--turn` is `node=degrees` (a `--turn` and a `--move` of the same node make one edit); all
three can repeat. `python tools/stage_map.py inflate disc/LVL/CENTRAL.NGP central.bin` writes the inflated image (the native
test's `WOTM_TEST_STAGE`). `make` refuses a node that is not a piece of the base stage.
To find a piece, take the position from `pieces` and look at it with the free camera (`WOTM_FREECAM=<s>@<x>,<y>,<z>,<heading>,<pitch>`,
`NATIVO.md`, "Diagnostics").

**How it loads.**
- **Stage select:** after RANDOM, the first 6 maps (by id, across all enabled mods) take the slots 18 to 23 with their name and
  photo, when their base stage is in that screen's list and unlocked (`NATIVO.md`, "Stage selection"). RANDOM never draws a map.
  Confirming a map loads its base stage (its music, stage code, spawn points) and applies the edits; the log says
  `[stages] <id>: applied N edits, M grid nodes relinked (K from reserve)`.
- **Direct match:** `WOTM_MATCH=3,1,downtown` (the map id in the stage field).
- **Same id in two mods:** the first one in mod order wins (`[stages] map <id>: <mod> beats <mod>`).
- **Online:** every PC needs the same mods folder. The map's files are part of the mod digest in the config hash, so a PC without
  the map (or with another version of it) is refused (`game configuration differs`). Today a map is picked online through
  `WOTM_MATCH`; picking one in the launcher's lobby is a follow-up.

**Known limits.**
- Only move, turn and remove: no duplicate or add, no ground or terrain edits.
- CPU routes (`PTS/<STAGE>.AIP`) are not updated: CPUs that hit a moved building climb it or steer around it.
- Spawn points and power-up places stay where the disc puts them.
- Trigger zones stay where the disc puts them, except 3-MILE's 13 that hang under pieces, which follow them.
- A pickup on a rooftop floats when its building moves (the pickup is its own piece: move it too).
- A `CONTROL` above a moved piece (the see-through "ghost" building switch: UFO, SANFRAN, ISLAND and others) keeps its volumes
  where the disc puts them, so the switch to the ghost version happens around the old place; the loader logs it.
- A `LOD` above a moved piece keeps its sphere (the loader only widens the culling spheres of the groups above), so the
  piece's level of detail switches by the distance to the old place; the loader logs it (`LOD <node> above it no longer covers it`).
- Water and kill zones were only researched (water is a height per stage plus the surface of collision polygons, which move with
  their hull); no live check covers them.
- Six maps listed at once in the stage select.

## Stage select photos
`mods/<mod>/levelpics/<name>.png` replaces the photo of the stages that `SHELL.TEX` does not have (`training`, `lakepowell`, `tokyodeathmatch`) and
that of the RANDOM entry (`random`; without it, a mosaic of the game's photos). 2:1 aspect ratio, any resolution. It takes precedence over the repo's
`levelpics/` folder (`NATIVO.md`, "Stage selection").

## Under the hood (for those who touch the code)

- **Files** (`native/wotm_mods.hpp`, `native/runtime/wotm_mods.inc`): every file the game reads goes through `fileCdSearchFile`
  (stages, monsters, `SHELL`, banks, music, movies) and then through `sceCdRead` (`fileReadf/a/s`, `zipInflateAll`,
  `snd_StreamSafeCdRead`). The search hook runs the original and, if the file is in `mods/`, returns a fake LSN (a range starting
  at 0x800000, beyond any DVD) and the mod's size; the `sceCdRead` hook serves that range by reading from the PC file. The native sound
  (`readLsnRaw`) reads banks and music through the same range. The native layer that reads the disc by name also looks in `mods/` first:
  `.RTX` palettes (`Scene::loadResources`, which reads the file directly, not from RAM), movies (`wotm_fmv.hpp`), the save list's icon,
  photos and monster (`wotm::disc::readFile`). With mods on, the hooks are installed even when `mods/` is empty or missing (a skin
  saved by the character creator registers after boot); with nothing registered they only call the original. `WOTM_MODS=0` installs none. A file that does not exist on the disc
  is also served ("new file").
- **Log:** `[mods] N file(s) from <mods> in <folder>` at boot and, on the first search for each file, `[mods] MON/LIZARD0.TEX <-
  teste_togera (110080 bytes; disc 110080)`, with a WARNING when the mod's file is larger (outside `MON/*`, whose load is contiguous above
  32 MB).
- **PNG** (`native/wotm_texmods.hpp`, `Scene::modTexture`): the game keeps loading the `.TEX`/`.RTX` from the disc; the native drawing swaps the
  image in `textureId` (objects) and in `residentTexture` (screen quads: enemy bars, font). The disc texId comes from the
  offset of the `texInfo[id]` packet inside the loaded file (`fileStatus.texAddr`/`resAddr`, name in `names`); the
  resident ones, through the DBP. A PNG larger than the original gets mipmaps. Particles: `Scene::modParticle` in `particleTexture` and in `fxTexture`. The 3D monster on the select screen and in the save list: `model::Model::decodeTex` (`wotm_model.hpp`). Not covered: composited dust and the emulated GS (for
  that one, `modkit.py pack --inject`).

## Caveats

- A mod file larger than the disc's (`.TEX`, `.RTX`, `.NGP`, `.BNK`): the game loads into fixed-size regions and may overwrite
  what comes after (the log and `check` warn). With a PNG this does not happen: the game's texture does not change size.
- Custom monsters use a game type; monsters with their own files do not exist yet (`TODO.md`, item 8).

Example (`WOTM_MATCH=3,1`, `3,1,2,5,1` and `1,3,1` with AI): Togera's skin as a 4x PNG (1024 × 1024 instead of 256)
and the portrait at 2x in the player's HUD and in the enemy bar; the kit does export, editing, pack (PNG, `.VAG`, a sound from `SHELL_S.BNK`),
re-export without losing edits, and check. Photos: `docs/screenshots/2026-10-22/2026-10-22_mods_png_*`.
