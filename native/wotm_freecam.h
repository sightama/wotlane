// Debug free camera (F5). Two sides:
//  - window (wotm_freecam.inc, presentation thread): keys and mouse move the pose on every draw, using real time;
//  - EE thread (wotm_overrides.cpp): the pose goes into view 0's _cs after Cameras::Update and on entry to viewUpdate,
//    so the game itself sees the new camera (matrices, culling, LOD, particles, sound, camera-relative controls).
// The pose uses the game's convention (mathfRotationFromVector): heading around Z, 0 = +Y, positive toward +X; pitch up;
// no roll. The rows of the _cs matrix are right, forward and up.
